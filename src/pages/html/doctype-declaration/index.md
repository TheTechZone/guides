## Doctype Declaration
A *doctype*, short for *document type declaration*, is a preamble instruction used to tell the browser which type of document it currently parses. In the case of HTML **it is required** to write ```<!DOCTYPE html> ``` at the top of the document to make sure the browser will render the page in a standard compliant way.
